            "The Alberta Express Entry Stream allows the province of Alberta to nominate qualified candidates from the Government of Canada's Express Entry pool. Under Alberta Express Entry Stream qualified candidates may be selected for nomination through general draws or if they highly skilled tech professionals under an Accelerated Tech pathway.Complete our FREE assessment to find out if you are eligible for Canadian immigration!Table of ContentsOverviewGeneral Express Entry Stream Selection CriteriaAccelerated Tech Pathway Selection CriteriaAccelerated Tech Pathway List of Eligible OccupationsContact us for AssistanceOverviewYou may get selected for the Alberta Advantage Immigrant Program, formerly known as the Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP), if you have strong ties to Alberta or if you can help support the government’s economic development and diversification priorities.If you are nominated by a Canadian province, you receive 600 additional Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) points, and an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence in a subsequent draw from the Express Entry candidate pool.International graduates who have completed their studies in a Canadian post-secondary institution may also be considered under this stream.General Express Entry Stream Selection CriteriaYou can only apply to the Alberta Express Entry stream after receiving a Notification of Interest (NOI) letter from the province. Eligible candidates will be contacted directly by the AAIP through their Express Entry profile.Only those Express Entry candidates who receive an invitation, or NOI letter from the AAIP can submit an application for a provincial nomination under the Alberta Express Entry Stream.The AAIP will select candidates based on the self-declared information in their Express Entry profile.You may receive a NOI if you:Have an active Express Entry profile in the federal Express Entry pool;Have stated an interest in immigrating permanently to Alberta;Are working in an occupation that supports Alberta’s economic development and diversification; andHave a minimum CRS score of 300.In addition, the AAIP is more likely to select you if you have one or more adaptability factors.

            "25 May 2023With a strategic location, competitive taxes and a multicultural workforce that is well-educated, highly-skilled and productive, British Columbia is one of Canada’s most dynamic places to do business, presenting unique opportunities for entrepreneurs.The British Columbia Entrepreneur Immigration stream of the British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program (BC PNP) has a unique registration system, known as the Entrepreneur Immigration Registration. The registration process functions like an 'Expression of Interest Model', which means eligible candidates, who have registered, must be invited to apply before they can submit an application to the program. Successful candidates will obtain a work permit and, if the business operation in British Columbia fulfills the requirements of the stream on an ongoing basis, they will be able to apply for permanent residence in Canada through the BC PNP. This stream provides a pathway to Canadian permanent residence for experienced businesspeople who can establish themselves in B.C. and invest in and operate a commercially viable business that can provide significant benefits to the provincial economy.NOTE: New registrations under the Entrepreneur Immigration - Base Category have been temporarily suspended. The province is expected to announce a reopening date for this stream in early 2022.To learn more about the BC PNP Entrepreneur Immigration Stream, this page will cover the following topics:BC PNP Entrepreneur Immigration Stream OverviewPre-Registration ProcessRegistration RequirementsRegistration ScoringSelf-DeclaredBusiness ConceptFinal Scoring and Selection PoolInvitation to ApplyWork Permit Period and Business EstablishmentNomination RequirementsBC PNP Entrepreneur Immigration - Base Category OverviewMinimum Requirements for CandidatesPersonal net worth of at least $600,000 (including cash, assets in bank accounts, fixed deposits, real properties, investments, etc).

            "Last updated: \n",
            "14 March 2023The Skilled Worker categories operate through an 'Expression of Interest' system, whereby eligible candidates complete a series of questions online and receive a score based on the answers they provide. The highest-scoring candidates may be invited to submit an application to the MPNP. There are no limits on the number of candidates who can submit an Expression of Interest and no deadline.There are two pathways to Manitoba as a skilled worker, both of which operate under the MPNP Expression of Interest System:Skilled Worker in Manitoba CategoryNote: Manitoba will introduce two new pathways under this category: Manitoba Work Experience Pathway and Manitoba Employer Direct Recruitment Pathway.Skilled Worker Overseas CategoryNote: Manitoba will introduce two new pathways under this category: Manitoba Express Entry Pathway and Human Capital Pathway The first is an enhanced pathway for eligible Express Entry pool candidates and the second is a pathway aligned with Manitoba's newly published list of in-demand occupations.Manitoba In-Demand Occupations List It is important to note that the eligibility criteria for the two categories remain in effect as of today. This page will be updated once renewed criteria for the two categories come into effect.Skilled Worker in Manitoba CategoryUnder the Skilled Worker in Manitoba category, applications are accepted from qualified temporary foreign workers and international student graduates who are currently working in Manitoba and have been offered a permanent job with their Manitoba employer. Candidates must meet the minimum requirements listed below to be entered into the Expression of Interest pool where they will be ranked according to a number of factors. Minimum Requirements for ApplicantsIn order to be eligible under the Skilled Workers in Manitoba category of the MPNP, candidates must:Be either a qualified temporary foreign worker OR an international student graduate;International student graduates must have attended an authorized education or training program at a public, or registered private vocational, post-secondary institution in Manitoba. (Language programs are specifically excluded.)The academic/vocational program must have been full-time and at least one academic year in length.The candidate must have successfully completed the program and have been awarded a diploma, degree, or certificate.Have a permanent, full-time job offer from their current Manitoba employer;Have worked for their current Manitoba employer continuously for at least six months;Any periods of self-employment, unauthorized work or periods of employment during which candidates were engaged in full-time study (e.g. work experience gained on a co-op permit) will not be included when calculating the period of qualifying work experience in Manitoba.Hold a valid Work Permit or Post-Graduation Work Permit from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC);Have all qualifications for the position including training/education and any required licence or certification;Have job-ready English; specifically, candidates must demonstrate the English or French proficiency to fulfill the duties of their job description;Have a connection to Manitoba through employment that is stronger than ties they may have to another province;Demonstrate in a Settlement Plan intention and ability to live, work and establish their work and family life in Manitoba as a permanent resident; andDemonstrate they have sufficient settlement funds — generally $10,000 CAD for the principal applicant, plus $2,000 CAD for each dependent included in the application.NOTE: A candidate who has graduated from a post-secondary program in a Canadian province other than Manitoba and who wants to apply to the MPNP under this category because he or she has been offered a job in Manitoba must first have been working for that Manitoba employer for at least one year in order to be eligible.Minimum Requirements for EmployersAdditionally, employers making job offers must:Be incorporated or registered by or under an act of the legislature of a province or the Parliament of Canada;Be operating as a business that has an established production capability, plant or place of business in Manitoba;Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the MPNP that they are an established business with an ability to offer the candidate full-time and long-term employment in Manitoba;Provide an offer of employment letter to the candidate that:is signed,is on company letterhead,specifies salary/wage and any other details of the position.The ProcessManitoba’s Expression of Interest (EOI) system involves a three-step process.In step one, potential candidates make an expression of interest in immigrating to Manitoba by answering a series of questions and creating an online profile. The profiles of eligible candidates are assigned a score based on the answers provided and placed in the Manitoba EOI pool with other eligible candidates. Candidates are ranked according to the unique MPNP Ranking Points system and given a score out of a maximum of 1,000.In step two, the highest-scoring candidates may be invited to apply to the MPNP. When a candidate is drawn from the EOI pool, he or she receives a Letter of Advice to Apply (LAA). After receiving an LAA, candidates will have only 60 days to submit a complete and accurate application to the province of Manitoba.In step three, after obtaining a nomination from the province of Manitoba, a candidate then submits his or her complete paperwork to IRCC and applies for Canadian permanent residence.When Not to ApplyCandidates will not be considered under the Skilled Worker in Manitoba category if they are:Self-employed individuals, business owners, owner-operators, or individuals providing services as independent contractors to the business supporting their application;Exempt from requiring a work permit to work in Manitoba (e.g. Ministers of Religion);Submitting an application based on an employment offer that is part of a work-study program.Refugee claimants, or individuals involved in a federal appeal or removal process;Live-in Caregivers currently living in Canada;Temporary Foreign Workers currently working and residing in a province other than Manitoba;Spouses of Canadian Citizens or permanent residents;Individuals who have been refused by the MPNP within the last six months and who are not able to address the reason(s) for refusal; andIndividuals who have an active immigration application with any other provincial immigration program in Canada.Skilled Worker Overseas CategoryThe Manitoba Skilled Workers Overseas category is for qualified skilled workers who may be outside of Canada but who can demonstrate a strong connection to the province. This program uses a points-based system to assess candidates according to factors such as age, language proficiency, work experience, education and adaptability. Minimum RequirementsTo be eligible under this category, candidates must:Obtain a minimum score of 60 out of 100 points on the points assessment grid; andDemonstrate an established connection to Manitoba through the support of friends or family, previous work experience or education in the province, or an Invitation to Apply issued by the MPNP,Each form of connection to the province has specific requirements.Manitoba SupportIn order to be a Manitoba Supporter, an individual must be:Able to provide documents proving that he or she has been living in Manitoba continuously for a minimum of one year;A Canadian citizen or permanent resident; Able to demonstrate sufficiently close ties to the applicant and the province;For close relatives, both the applicant and the supporter must provide documents proving their familial relationship.Close relatives are considered to be those related to the applicant (or the applicant’s spouse) in one of the following ways:Sister or brother,Niece or nephew,Aunt or uncle,First cousin,Mother or father,Grandmother or grandfather.Able to demonstrate that any applications they previously supported resulted in successful, permanent economic establishment in Manitoba;Able to support the applicant’s Settlement Plan.Paid immigration representatives and Canadian elected officials and their staff cannot be Manitoba Supporters. Children living in Manitoba cannot support their parents; instead, it is recommended they refer to Parent and Grandparents Sponsorship.Manitoba ExperienceIn order to apply with the connection of Manitoba Experience, candidates must have lived in the province in the past as either a temporary foreign worker or as an international student. To be eligible, those with previous work experience in Manitoba must:Have worked full-time for a Manitoba employer for a minimum of six consecutive months;Submit a signed employer letter of reference on company letterhead; andSubmit a copy of their work permit proving they worked in the province.Those with previous educational experience in Manitoba must:Have attended and completed an authorized education or training program at a public, or registered private vocational, post-secondary institution in Manitoba; andSubmit their study permit(s), academic transcripts and certificate, diploma or degree they received upon completion of the program.Manitoba InvitationInvitations to apply for permanent residence are issued regularly by the MPNP to qualified candidates identified as part of one of its Strategic Recruitment Initiatives. Invitations to Apply are issued at the discretion of the MPNP, therefore applicants may not choose to use this connection to Manitoba on their own.Candidates are required to submit the Letter of Invitation they received from the MPNP following their interview during a recruitment mission or exploratory visit. The MPNP conducts overseas recruitment missions regularly, often in partnership with Manitoba employers, during which they search for prospective immigrants.During set periods, the MPNP accepts requests to make an exploratory visit to Manitoba. This visit enables potential MPNP applicants to research communities and employment opportunities in order to decide whether they have genuine intention and ability to settle in Manitoba as permanent residents. Exploratory visits must be approved by and arranged through the MPNP only by invitation. The MPNP provides instructions on what to do during the visit and what documents candidates are required to bring with them.In order to be eligible for an exploratory visit candidates must:Be between the ages of 21 and 45;Be able to demonstrate the employability and adaptability required of all MPNP applicants;Have completed, at minimum, a one-year, post-secondary education or training program for which they received a diploma, degree or certificate;Have at least two years of full-time work experience in the past five years;Demonstrate their ability to find a job in Manitoba in the same occupation in which they have two years of experience;This includes plans to achieve the appropriate licence or certification required in the case of regulated occupations.Submit a Settlement Plan that demonstrates their genuine intention and ability to economically establish and settle in Manitoba as a permanent resident; andSubmit official results of an approved language test taken within the past two years showing they achieved scores equivalent to at least CLB 6 in each component as well as overall.Points AssessmentIn addition to the above requirement of demonstrating a connection to Manitoba, candidates must score at least 60 out of 100 points on the points assessment grid. Points are assessed based on five factors: language proficiency, age, work experience, education and adaptability. Factor 1: Language ProficiencyPointsFirst language (English or French) CLB 8 or higher / native speaker20CLB 718CLB 616CLB 514CLB 4 *  12CLB 3 or lower0Second language (English or French) CLB 5 or higher5Factor 2: Age 18419620821 to 451046847648449250 or older0Factor 3: Work Experience (in the past five years) Less than one year0One year8Two years10Three years12Four years or more15Factor 4: Education Master's or Doctorate25Two post-secondary programs of at least two years each23One post-secondary program of two years or longer20One one year post-secondary program14Trade certification14No post-secondary education0Factor 5: Adaptability ** Close relative in Manitoba20Invitation to Apply received from MPNP as part of recruitment mission or exploratory visit20Previous work experience in Manitoba (at least six months)12Completed post-secondary program of two years or more in Manitoba12Completed post-secondary program of at least one year in Manitoba10Friend or distant relative living in Manitoba10Bonus: Intention to reside outside Winnipeg5Total100* Candidates with a job offer of National Occupation Classification (NOC) C or D are required to demonstrate a language level of at least Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) 4 in English, or niveaux de compétence linguistique canadiens (NCLC) 4 in French, in order to be eligible to apply.** A connection to Manitoba is required of all applicants, regardless of their points score in other factors.

To Apply (ITA) for permanent residence in a subsequent Express Entry Draw.This pathway is open to candidates who meet the eligibility criteria and have experience in a Manitoba In-demand Occupation. This stream may also be open to candidates who are eligible under another MPNP stream.Eligibility CriteriaCriterionMinimum RequirementExpress EntryDemonstrate acceptance into the Express

a provincial nomination.This is known as a draw.Invited persons may apply for an 'enhanced' provincial nomination under the MPNP.Enhanced nominations are aligned with the federal Express Entry system. Successful applicants receive 600 additional Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) points.After the nomination is uploaded to the Express Entry profile, an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent

            "Last updated: \n",
            "14 March 2023The Skilled Worker categories operate through an 'Expression of Interest' system, whereby eligible candidates complete a series of questions online and receive a score based on the answers they provide. The highest-scoring candidates may be invited to submit an application to the MPNP. There are no limits on the number of candidates who can submit an Expression of Interest and no deadline.There are two pathways to Manitoba as a skilled worker, both of which operate under the MPNP Expression of Interest System:Skilled Worker in Manitoba CategoryNote: Manitoba will introduce two new pathways under this category: Manitoba Work Experience Pathway and Manitoba Employer Direct Recruitment Pathway.Skilled Worker Overseas CategoryNote: Manitoba will introduce two new pathways under this category: Manitoba Express Entry Pathway and Human Capital Pathway The first is an enhanced pathway for eligible Express Entry pool candidates and the second is a pathway aligned with Manitoba's newly published list of in-demand occupations.Manitoba In-Demand Occupations List It is important to note that the eligibility criteria for the two categories remain in effect as of today. This page will be updated once renewed criteria for the two categories come into effect.Skilled Worker in Manitoba CategoryUnder the Skilled Worker in Manitoba category, applications are accepted from qualified temporary foreign workers and international student graduates who are currently working in Manitoba and have been offered a permanent job with their Manitoba employer. Candidates must meet the minimum requirements listed below to be entered into the Expression of Interest pool where they will be ranked according to a number of factors. Minimum Requirements for ApplicantsIn order to be eligible under the Skilled Workers in Manitoba category of the MPNP, candidates must:Be either a qualified temporary foreign worker OR an international student graduate;International student graduates must have attended an authorized education or training program at a public, or registered private vocational, post-secondary institution in Manitoba. (Language programs are specifically excluded.)The academic/vocational program must have been full-time and at least one academic year in length.The candidate must have successfully completed the program and have been awarded a diploma, degree, or certificate.Have a permanent, full-time job offer from their current Manitoba employer;Have worked for their current Manitoba employer continuously for at least six months;Any periods of self-employment, unauthorized work or periods of employment during which candidates were engaged in full-time study (e.g. work experience gained on a co-op permit) will not be included when calculating the period of qualifying work experience in Manitoba.Hold a valid Work Permit or Post-Graduation Work Permit from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC);Have all qualifications for the position including training/education and any required licence or certification;Have job-ready English; specifically, candidates must demonstrate the English or French proficiency to fulfill the duties of their job description;Have a connection to Manitoba through employment that is stronger than ties they may have to another province;Demonstrate in a Settlement Plan intention and ability to live, work and establish their work and family life in Manitoba as a permanent resident; andDemonstrate they have sufficient settlement funds — generally $10,000 CAD for the principal applicant, plus $2,000 CAD for each dependent included in the application.NOTE: A candidate who has graduated from a post-secondary program in a Canadian province other than Manitoba and who wants to apply to the MPNP under this category because he or she has been offered a job in Manitoba must first have been working for that Manitoba employer for at least one year in order to be eligible.Minimum Requirements for EmployersAdditionally, employers making job offers must:Be incorporated or registered by or under an act of the legislature of a province or the Parliament of Canada;Be operating as a business that has an established production capability, plant or place of business in Manitoba;Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the MPNP that they are an established business with an ability to offer the candidate full-time and long-term employment in Manitoba;Provide an offer of employment letter to the candidate that:is signed,is on company letterhead,specifies salary/wage and any other details of the position.The ProcessManitoba’s Expression of Interest (EOI) system involves a three-step process.In step one, potential candidates make an expression of interest in immigrating to Manitoba by answering a series of questions and creating an online profile. The profiles of eligible candidates are assigned a score based on the answers provided and placed in the Manitoba EOI pool with other eligible candidates. Candidates are ranked according to the unique MPNP Ranking Points system and given a score out of a maximum of 1,000.In step two, the highest-scoring candidates may be invited to apply to the MPNP. When a candidate is drawn from the EOI pool, he or she receives a Letter of Advice to Apply (LAA). After receiving an LAA, candidates will have only 60 days to submit a complete and accurate application to the province of Manitoba.In step three, after obtaining a nomination from the province of Manitoba, a candidate then submits his or her complete paperwork to IRCC and applies for Canadian permanent residence.When Not to ApplyCandidates will not be considered under the Skilled Worker in Manitoba category if they are:Self-employed individuals, business owners, owner-operators, or individuals providing services as independent contractors to the business supporting their application;Exempt from requiring a work permit to work in Manitoba (e.g. Ministers of Religion);Submitting an application based on an employment offer that is part of a work-study program.Refugee claimants, or individuals involved in a federal appeal or removal process;Live-in Caregivers currently living in Canada;Temporary Foreign Workers currently working and residing in a province other than Manitoba;Spouses of Canadian Citizens or permanent residents;Individuals who have been refused by the MPNP within the last six months and who are not able to address the reason(s) for refusal; andIndividuals who have an active immigration application with any other provincial immigration program in Canada.Skilled Worker Overseas CategoryThe Manitoba Skilled Workers Overseas category is for qualified skilled workers who may be outside of Canada but who can demonstrate a strong connection to the province. This program uses a points-based system to assess candidates according to factors such as age, language proficiency, work experience, education and adaptability. Minimum RequirementsTo be eligible under this category, candidates must:Obtain a minimum score of 60 out of 100 points on the points assessment grid; andDemonstrate an established connection to Manitoba through the support of friends or family, previous work experience or education in the province, or an Invitation to Apply issued by the MPNP,Each form of connection to the province has specific requirements.Manitoba SupportIn order to be a Manitoba Supporter, an individual must be:Able to provide documents proving that he or she has been living in Manitoba continuously for a minimum of one year;A Canadian citizen or permanent resident; Able to demonstrate sufficiently close ties to the applicant and the province;For close relatives, both the applicant and the supporter must provide documents proving their familial relationship.Close relatives are considered to be those related to the applicant (or the applicant’s spouse) in one of the following ways:Sister or brother,Niece or nephew,Aunt or uncle,First cousin,Mother or father,Grandmother or grandfather.Able to demonstrate that any applications they previously supported resulted in successful, permanent economic establishment in Manitoba;Able to support the applicant’s Settlement Plan.Paid immigration representatives and Canadian elected officials and their staff cannot be Manitoba Supporters.

Invitations to Apply are issued at the discretion of the MPNP, therefore applicants may not choose to use this connection to Manitoba on their own.Candidates are required to submit the Letter of Invitation they received from the MPNP following their interview during a recruitment mission or exploratory visit. The MPNP conducts overseas recruitment missions regularly, often in partnership with Manitoba employers, during which they search for prospective immigrants.During set periods, the MPNP accepts requests to make an exploratory visit to Manitoba. This visit enables potential MPNP applicants to research communities and employment opportunities in order to decide whether they have genuine intention and ability to settle in Manitoba as permanent residents. Exploratory visits must be approved by and arranged through the MPNP only by invitation. The MPNP provides instructions on what to do during the visit and what documents candidates are required to bring with them.In order to be eligible for an exploratory visit candidates must:Be between the ages of 21 and 45;Be able to demonstrate the employability and adaptability required of all MPNP applicants;Have completed, at minimum, a one-year, post-secondary education or training program for which they received a diploma, degree or certificate;Have at least two years of full-time work experience in the past five years;Demonstrate their ability to find a job in Manitoba in the same occupation in which they have two years of experience;This includes plans to achieve the appropriate licence or certification required in the case of regulated occupations.Submit a Settlement Plan that demonstrates their genuine intention and ability to economically establish and settle in Manitoba as a permanent resident; andSubmit official results of an approved language test taken within the past two years showing they achieved scores equivalent to at least CLB 6 in each component as well as overall.Points AssessmentIn addition to the above requirement of demonstrating a connection to Manitoba, candidates must score at least 60 out of 100 points on the points assessment grid.

The main purpose of the visit is to pass the MPNP interview, though making local contacts and seeking employment opportunities are also suggested.The MPNP requires that the candidate ensure he or she meets all minimum criteria at the time of the exploratory visit. It is also the responsibility of the applicant to maintain no connections throughout their application and until their arrival outside of Morden and in other parts of Canada. This means that if a friend or family connection moved outside Morden, the application will be reassessed by Morden's Selection Committee to reevaluate Morden's continued support of the application. Application process:The following steps provide an overview of the application process. In order to apply and come to Canada, an individual may:Step 1: Determine his or her eligibility (requirements above).Step 2: MCDII will only be accepting applications from those who have an active Express Entry profile (with the exception of Welders and Carpenters). Step 3: Submit an application (include Federal Express Entry number, if applicable). Candidates must have the following items in order to apply:Application form;C.V. or resume for the principal applicant and spouse;Copy of passport;IELTS result; andProof of Settlement Funds (scan of bank statement and/or property estimation).Step 4: If an individual is selected, he or she will be given an invitation to come for an exploratory visit.Step 5: During the exploratory visit, the candidate will research Morden and prepare for his or her interview with an MPNP officer at the end of the visit.Step 6: If after the interview with the MPNP officer, the officer deems the individual is a good fit for MCDII and MPNP, he or she will be given an invitation to apply for MPNP.Step 7: The individual may apply online for provincial nomination through the MPNP. This is usually done after he or she returns home from the exploratory visit.Step 8: If, after the individual is reviewed by MPNP, it is determined that he or she meets all minimum qualifications of MPNP, he or she will be given a Nomination Letter from the MPNP.Step 9: Using this Nomination Letter, the individual may apply to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC, formerly CIC) as a provincial nominee. Step 10: IRCC will do further review, including medicals and criminal record checks.Step 11: Once the individual receives Permanent Residence Visas, he or she can make arrangements to move to Morden, along with any accompanying family members.Discover your options for Canada immigration by completing our free assessment form.\n",

Individuals who meet the eligibility requirements for the program (listed above) will be placed into a pool of potential applicants and will be assigned a score based on the PGES points-based system.The highest-ranked candidates will be selected from the pool and invited to apply to the program. To rank candidates, the NBPNP will assess candidates based on a point-based system called the Comprehensive Ranking System.Candidates who obtain higher scores will have a better chance of receiving an Invitation to Apply (ITA). It is important that candidates review the eligibility requirements of the program when submitting an EOI to the program. 2. Receiving an Invitation to Apply (ITA)After obtaining an ITA letter, candidates are required to submit a complete application to the NBPNP within 90 days. The ITA letter includes a number that the applicant will need to include with the application. 3. Completing the application and attending an interviewWhen preparing the application, it is important that the candidate answers all the questions in the form, provides the necessary documents in the required format, and signs the forms as required. Supporting documents that are neither in English or French must be translated by a certified translator or interpreter that is a member of a translation or interpretation provincial or territorial organization.  As part of the application, the candidate is responsible for providing and paying for an Audit Opinion and Special Purpose Report. The report must be completed by a New Brunswick designated Audit Service Verifier. The Audit opinion will include an audit of the financial statements of the business and the Special Purpose Report must include the following:The financial viability and sustainability of the business discussing any relevant issues affecting the business’ ability to continue in the near future as a going concern;Recommendation for the business to improve its viability and sustainability;A determination of any issues, challenges or concerns pertaining to auditing the financial statements; andA business review which may include but is not limited to market analysis, product analysis, competitive analysis, and financial analysis.When assessing an application, the NBPNP will conduct a full review of the application and verify the information provided in the EOI. Applicants who meet the eligibility requirements will be invited to participate in an in-person interview with a NBPNP Immigration Officer. The applicant needs to be available for an interview within 15 business days of receiving the request. The interview will include a site visit to the business. There are two possible outcomes following the interview:Refusal Decision: If the interview is unsuccessful, the applicant will receive a refusal letter from the Department with no possibility of appeal.Nomination Decision: If the interview is successful, the applicant will receive a nomination certificate which remains valid for six months from the date of issuance.4. Applying for Canadian permanent residence with IRCCCandidates must submit a complete Canadian permanent residence application and provide the required supporting documents to IRCC before the New Brunswick provincial nomination certificate expires within six months.  5. Reporting landingIf the permanent residence application is approved by IRCC, a permanent resident visa will be issued to the applicant (and spouse/partner and/or dependents, if applicable). It is important to report landing using the correct forms within 30 days of obtaining a permanent resident visa to finalize the settlement process with the NBPNP. The New Brunswick business must remain in operation for a minimum of three years after receiving permanent residence in Canada. \n",

            "Newfoundland and Labrador is Canada’s easternmost province and has evolved into a significant economic force in the Canadian landscape.The province consists of two distinct land masses: Labrador, which is connected to the mainland, and the island of Newfoundland. The NLPNP is Newfoundland and Labrador’s Provincial Nominee Program. Through this program, prospective immigrants with the skills and experience targeted by the province may receive a Newfoundland and Labrador provincial nomination.Complete our FREE assessment to find out if you are eligible for Canadian immigration!Table of ContentsOverview of the Newfoundland and Labrador PNPNewfoundland and Labrador Immigration StreamsNewfoundland and Labrador Express Entry Skilled WorkerSkilled Worker CategoryInternational Graduate CategoryInternational Entrepreneur CategoryInternational Graduate Entrepreneur CategoryAtlantic Immigration PilotContact us for AssistanceOverview of the Newfoundland and Labrador PNPThe Newfoundland and Labrador Provincial Nominee Program (NLPNP) has been in operation since 1999. It was one of the first PNPs to launch.Like with other PNPs, this program looks to attract more immigrants to the province to address economic and labour market needs.The NLPNP attracts skilled workers, entrepreneurs and international graduates who have the skills, experience and education to succeed in the Atlantic province.The PNP as well as the Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP), Newfoundland and Labrador are welcoming an increasing number of immigrants.The AIP is a fast-track immigration program that allows employers in the Atlantic provinces to hire foreign nationals. The Atlantic provinces are New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.The province welcomes 1,200 new immigrants every year, and is looking to welcome 1,700 new immigrants annually.The NLPNP has one enhanced category, the NL Express Entry Skilled Worker category. The remaining categories are base categories.An enhanced category is one that is aligned with the federal Express Entry system. Contrastingly, a base category is one that is not aligned with the Express Entry system.Express Entry is the system that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) uses to manage the main economic class immigration programs.Those who have an Express Entry profile are given a score based on the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS).During regular Express Entry draws, Canada invites the highest-ranking candidates to apply for permanent residence.If you are nominated through a provincial program such as the NL Express Entry Skilled Worker category, you are awarded an additional 600 CRS points.This means that you will get an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence in a subsequent draw.You will also get your nomination through the Express Entry profile, which you will have to accept before you get the additional points.The advantage of enhanced streams is that processing is much quicker. It may take just six months for you to get your Canadian permanent residence.Base streams make up most immigration streams under PNPs. These streams are not aligned with the Express Entry system. If you get a provincial nomination through a base stream, you will need to apply directly to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).Unlike enhanced streams, base streams tend to have a processing standard of 12 months or more.Newfoundland and Labrador Immigration StreamsIf you wish to immigrate to Newfoundland and Labrador, then you have five options to choose from:Newfoundland and Labrador Express Entry Skilled Worker;Skilled Worker Category;International Graduate Category;International Entrepreneur Category;International Graduate Entrepreneur Category.The Newfoundland and Labrador Express Entry Skilled Worker is for skilled workers who have a job offer and who have an Express Entry profile.The Skilled Worker Category is for skilled workers who have a job offer from a Newfoundland and Labrador employer.

The number of jobs in the business and the wages cannot be lowered when the business is purchased.Step 2: Further Investigations and Face‐to‐Face Interview(s)Prospective applicants are required to make at least one (1) business trip to the Northwest Territories prior to being invited to submit an application in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the Northwest Territories business environment and the necessary steps to turn a working business concept into a business plan. The trip must be no less than four (4) full business days in length, not including travel days (to and from the Northwest Territories), interview day(s) and statutory holidays. After the business trip, prospective applicants must participate in at least one face‐to‐face interview with Nominee Program staff to review the working business concept, and to assess the foreign national's knowledge of the Northwest Territories and his or her business and communication skills. One interview must be held at the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment headquarters in Yellowknife and one must be held with the relevant regional office.If a prospective applicant is intending to invest in an existing business in the Northwest Territories, the owner of the business must also attend a separate interview with NTNP staff.Step 3: Expression of InterestAfter the interview, the prospective applicant will be notified of the results. If the interview was successful, the prospective applicant will have sixty (60) days to submit the following:a written summary of the working business concept with a basic outline of the investments that will be made; and a summary of their findings from the business trip to the Northwest Territories. If the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment finds the information provided satisfactorily, approves the business concept based on its ability to provide value to the territory, finds that the applicants has sufficient requisite business and communication skills, and believes the prospective applicant is sincere in their desire to move and settle in the NWT, an invitation to apply will be issued to the applicant. Step 4: Formal ApplicationOnce invited to formally apply, the candidate has nine months to submit a complete application to the Nominee Program.

Incomplete applications will not be processed and the applicant will be notified. The NWT Nominee Program discourages applicants from making any investment or financial commitment prior to signing a Business Performance Agreement and obtaining a work permit.Step 5: Application ReviewAfter the complete formal application is submitted, both the applicant and the business plan will be reviewed according to the eligibility criteria. NTNP staff may request additional documentation and/or an additional interview to verify information within the application. Nominee Program staff will then either recommend the applicant for entry into the NTNP or deem him/her ineligible. This recommendation is reviewed by the Assistant Deputy Minister of the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment who makes the final decision to accept or refuse the application.Application reviews are based on (but are not limited to) the following criteria:The ability of the business to create jobs for local residents;The ability of the business to be sustainable in the NWT over the long-term based on local market researchThe ability of the business to provide significant economic benefits to the Territory based on local market researchThe ability of the prospective applicant to successfully implement the business based on their skills and pastexperienceThe ability of the prospective applicant to successfully implement business based on the realistic nature of the submitted business plan; andAccurate financial statements, with substantiation, in the submitted business plan.Step 6: Approval and the Business Performance AgreementOnce accepted, the applicant will be notified in writing by NTNP staff. The NTNP will then begin negotiating a Business Performance Agreement with the applicant, which outlines the terms under which the applicant is to execute the business plan. Once the agreement is signed and the refundable $75,000 CAD good faith deposit has been received, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment will provide the applicant with a letter of support for a two-year temporary work permit, which the applicant may submit along with his or her application to IRCC.In order to successfully fulfill the requirements of the Business Performance Agreement and be nominated, applicants must reside within 100 kilometres of the NWT business and must reside in the Northwest Territories for at least 75 percent of the time while on a work permit.Step 7: Developing the BusinessSix months after arriving in the Northwest Territories, the applicant must be prepared to establish the business and make the necessary investment. NTNP staff will monitor the business' progression and meet with the applicant from time to time. Part of this process involves the applicant submitting an Interim Report to the NWT Nominee Program every six (6) months. A key requirement in this report is the inclusion of proof of spending for the required eligible investment. The applicant has two years to develop the business described in the business plan in accordance with the Business Performance Agreement. The applicant must demonstrate that he or she is actively involved in and accountable for the management of the NWT business' daily operations. Active management must occur at the place of business in the Northwest Territories.Step 8: NominationUpon fulfillment of the terms set out in the Business Performance Agreement, the Government of Northwest Territories may issue a nomination certificate to the applicant.

            "Nova Scotia Skilled Worker StreamThe Skilled Worker stream helps Nova Scotia employers recruit and hire foreign workers and international graduates whose skills are in limited supply in the province.The Nova Scotia Nominee Program (NSNP) Skilled Worker Stream provides a Canadian immigration pathway to foreign nationals with the required skills for positions that the province has not been able to fill with a permanent resident or Canadian citizen. The Skilled Worker Stream is not an Express Entry-linked Stream, which means foreign nationals can apply for Canadian permanent residence even if they are not eligible to enter the federal Express Entry pool.The Nova Scotia Office of Immigration (NSOI) does not provide a specific occupation or skills shortage list for the Skilled Worker Stream. However, the NSOI utilizes the National Occupational Classification (NOC) to distinguish between three occupation types: Skilled Workers, Semi-skilled, and Low-skilled Workers.Skilled WorkersThis category is for individuals with experience in an occupation classified as NOC level 0, A or B, also known as skilled occupations. Priority is given to these highly skilled applicants.Semi-Skilled WorkersThis category is for workers whose occupations are classified as NOC level C. Applications in this category will only be considered if all eligibility criteria are met and the applicant has worked for at least six months with a Nova Scotia employer that is supporting his or her application for permanent residence.Low-Skilled WorkersThis category is for individuals whose occupations are classified as NOC level D. Applications in this category will only be considered if all eligibility criteria are met and the applicant has worked for at least six months with a Nova Scotia employer that is supporting his or her application for permanent residence. There must be a strong sense of support from an employer, such as contribution to the immigration fees, accommodation/housing, language training, and career training plans.The NSOI does not consider applications from individuals on a federal post-graduation work permit whose occupations are classified under NOC D.Eligibility Requirements for the Nova Scotia Skilled Worker StreamMinimum Requirements for ApplicantsIn addition to the general eligibility outlined above, all applicants, regardless of their work experience, must meet the following eligibility requirements:If living in Canada, provide proof of legal status;If applying from outside Canada, provide proof of legal status in their current country of residence.Be between the ages of 21 and 55 at the time of application;Have a full time, permanent job offer from a Nova Scotia employer (preferably for a NOC 0, A or B occupation). NOC C and D occupations will be considered based on labour market requirements/conditions, six (6) months of work with the same employer and indicators of success in the application;Have completed at least a high school level of education (12 years of study);Have the education, training, and licensing/certification needed to perform the job in Canada, if applicable;Have at least 12 months of relevant work experience in the past five years;Meet language requirements for the program;For NOC levels 0, A or B – CLB level 5 in English or French. If the applicant's first language is English or French, that is enough proof. If the applicant's first language is not English or French, he or she may submit the following as proof of language ability:Educational transcripts or other documentation indicating English or French as the principal language of instruction or communication;Employment history and references with English or French as the principal language of communication; or,Internationally recognised test results to prove a CLB/NCLC Level 5.For NOC levels C or D – CLB level 4 in English or French. Semi-skilled and low-skilled workers must have test results to prove they meet CLB 4 even if their first language is English or French;The NSOI will only consider test results from the following designated agencies:International English Language Testing System (IELTS) - General TrainingCanadian English Language Proficiency Index Program (CELPIP-General)Test d'Evaluation Du Français (TEF)Demonstrate the intent and ability to settle in the province of Nova Scotia; andDemonstrate sufficient settlement supports and financial resources to cover immigration costs and travel expenses (if applicable) and to successfully establish yourself in the province.Minimum Requirements for EmployersEmployers sponsoring applicants through this program must meet the following requirements:Be permanently established in Nova Scotia;Have operated in Nova Scotia, under current management, for at least two years;Issue a full time, permanent job offer to the individual applicant;The job must:Be located in Nova Scotia;Have salary and benefits that meet provincial employment standards and prevailing wage rates;Be in a position for which there is a shortage of qualified Canadian citizens or permanent residents;Not contravene any existing bargaining unit agreements, labour agreements/standards, or be involved in any employment disputes; and,Job offers made to NOC level C or D occupations will be considered based on local labour market requirements and conditions;Demonstrate recruitment efforts to fill the position with evidence that predate the applicant's current offer of employment. Evidence can be either:a current positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA);a proof that the position offered or worker is considered to be LMIA exempt; orthree advertisements and related information that meet the conditions outlined.Have a history of good workplace and business practices, and must be compliant with all applicable laws and regulations.The Nova Scotia Skilled Worker Stream Application ProcessThe principal applicant must gather and prepare an application package based on the document checklist provided by the NSNP.The supporting employer must prepare an Employer form.The applicant submits the NSNP application online or by mail. If documents are missing, not translated by a certified translator, or are not clear, the application will not be assessedThe application is assessed by the NSOI beginning with a completion check. During the assessment, the NSOI may request an interview with the applicant and/or contact the employer to gather information or for clarification.If approved, the applicant will receive a letter from the NSOI to confirm their nomination.If the application is being considered for refusal, the applicant (or their representative) will be issued a letter of intent to refuse. The applicant has 10 business days to provide additional information to the NSOI. Nominated applicants may chose to apply for a temporary work permit or the renewal of an existing work permit with the support of the NSOI. The letter of support replaces the LMIA in applying for the new work permit. The work permit allows the applicant to continue working in Nova Scotia while the application for a Canadian permanent resident visa is being processed.The applicant must submit a complete application for a permanent resident visa within 6 months of obtaining a Letter of Nomination. IRCC makes the final decision on the granting of permanent resident visas based on an applicant continuing to meet the eligibility requirements and passing the medical, criminality or security checks.Once a Confirmation of Permanent Residence is issued to the applicant, his or her spouse and dependents, the applicant must contact the NSOI within 30 days of arriving in Canada.Who is not eligible to apply under the Nova Scotia Skilled Worker StreamForeign nationals should not apply under this stream, if they are:an individual who has received a nomination under the Nova Scotia Nominee Program dated within the last 12 months; an applicant under humanitarian and compassionate grounds, a refugee claimant or a failed refugee claimant;not legally present in your current country of residence;in Canada illegally, under a removal order, or are prohibited from entering or being in Canada;an individual who does not have status; you are not eligible to apply until your status has been restored;an international student who is currently studying at a Canadian post-secondary institution;an international graduate who has studied in Canada, whose studies have been sponsored by an agency or government and who is contractually obligated to return to their country of origin;on a federal post-graduation work permit whose occupation falls under NOC skill Level D;an individual with unresolved custody or child support disputes affecting any dependent;a seasonal, part-time or casual worker;in a sales position that is based solely on commission for compensation;an individual in Canada who is in the Caregiver Program;an individual whose job is not based in Nova Scotia;a passive investor (individuals who intend to invest in a Nova Scotia business with very limited or no involvement in the day-to-day management of the business);basing your application on a job offer where you are self-employed in Nova Scotia;basing your application on a job offer where you are a majority shareholder in a Nova Scotia business;basing your application on a job offer where you are intending to start a business and/or becoming self-employed in Nova Scotia.

On this survey, candidates will provide required information about their business ownership or management experience, language, education, investment, net worth, age, adaptability, and business. Only applicants who meet the minimum criteria will be able to submit an EOI. Candidates will be assessed based on a points matrix according to their profile and then assigned a score and added to the EOI pool. EOIs can remain in the pool for up to one year from the date of receipt. If the EOI is not selected during this time, it will be removed from the pool. After this point candidates may submit a new EOI if they so choose. If candidates are able to acquire additional points after submitting their EOI, they will need to submit a new one.Step 2: Invitation to ApplyTop scoring applicants will be notified by the Nova Scotia Office of Immigration (NSOI) that they are being invited to submit a formal application to the Nova Scotia Nominee Program (NSNP) in the form of an Invitation to Apply (ITA) letter. Complete applications received from those invited to apply will then undergo an assessment by the NSOI.Complete applications are expected to contain the following:A complete application form (submitted within 90 days of the issuance of the ITA letter);All supporting documentation (submitted within 90 days of the issuance of the ITA letter);A Business Establishment Plan (submitted within 90 days of the issuance of the ITA letter); andA Net Worth Verification Report prepared by one of NSOI’s designated Net Worth Verifiers (submitted within 180 days of the issuance of the ITA letter).NOTE: the candidate must notify the NSOI of his or her choice of Net Worth Verifier within 20 days of the issuance of the ITA letter.Step 3: In-Person Interview and Business Performance AgreementOnce the application has been assessed by the NSOI, those candidates who meet the outlined eligibility requirements (see below) will be contacted about an in-person interview with an official of the NSOI. All interviews will take place in Nova Scotia and are expected to take place within 60 days of the candidate being contacted. If the interview is successful, the candidate will be sent a Business Performance Agreement to review and sign. A business Performance Agreement is a legal agreement with the province that states the amount of investment the candidate will make and the business sector in which the business will operate, along with any other relevant information. Unsuccessful interviews or failure to participate in the interview within the 60 day time limit will result in closure of the application.The NSOI will issue an Entrepreneur Approval Letter and instructions on how to apply to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) for a work permit upon receipt of the Business Performance Agreement. Candidates are required to apply to IRCC for a work permit within two months of the date on the Entrepreneur Approval Letter. If IRCC refuses the work permit application, the candidate will no longer be eligible under the NSNP Entrepreneur Stream.Step 4: Temporary Work Permit and Business Establishment in Nova ScotiaApplicants who are successful in obtaining a work permit will be able to land in Nova Scotia with their family, settle, and start or acquire their business. Applicants are expected to do so within one year of receiving the Entrepreneur Approval Letter or their file will be closed. It is recommended that applicants start operating their business in Nova Scotia within six months of arriving in the province on a work permit.Approved applicants must attend an arrival meeting with an NSOI officer within 60 days of their arrival date. Officers will answer any questions related to the terms of the Business Performance Agreement and may refer candidates to other relevant service providers for further guidance and information. Candidates are required to bring a signed Arrival Report to the meeting.Step 5: Request for NominationOnce an applicant satisfies the conditions of the Business Performance Agreement, including, but not limited to, making the mandatory investment, operating the business continuously for a minimum of one year, and submitting a Business Establishment Progress Report to the NSOI, he or she can then apply to be nominated for permanent residence by the province of Nova Scotia under the NSNP by submitting a Nomination Request Form. The Nomination Request Form will ask for details of the business and will require the submission of an audit opinion and Special Purpose Report, both of which must be provided by an NSOI designated Audit Services Verifier of the candidate's choosing.The NSOI will communicate the nomination decision in writing to the applicant or their representative. If nominated by the NSNP:The applicant will receive a letter from the NSOI to confirm that a Nomination has been issued; andProof of Nomination, which expires six months after the date of issuance, will be sent directly to IRCC by the NSOI.In the event that the application is being considered for refusal, the applicant or their representative will receive a letter of intent to refuse from the NSOI. In this case, the applicant will be given 10 business days to submit additional information to be considered. After 10 business days the file, including any new information submitted, will be re-assessed and a final decision made, which will be sent in writing and which cannot be appealed.Step 6: Apply for Permanent Residence\n",
            "Upon nomination, the applicant will apply to IRCC for permanent residence within six months. Candidates should note that an NSNP nomination does not guarantee the issuance of a Permanent Resident Visa. If the application is approved by the visa office, the candidate will be issued a Confirmation of Permanent Residence. He or she is required to provide a copy of the confirmation to the NSOI within 30 business days. Business Establishment PlanThe Business Establishment Plan must be a coherent and well-thought-out plan for successful settlement and business development in Nova Scotia. The plan should demonstrate that the business meets the minimum required investment level and that the applicant will hold an active managerial position in the business. Additionally, it should show that the candidate has conducted extensive research into the economic, market, and cultural factors relevant to the proposed business.The Business Establishment Plan must include a detailed Action Plan that outlines, step by step, the planned actions of the business over the next two to three years. These actions include but are not limited to: financial actions required to start or buy the business, anticipated start date of the business, when staff will be hired, timing of planned export activities, etc.It is crucial that the applicant has complete knowledge and understanding of his or her Business Establishment Plan. In the event that the applicant is unaware of the plan’s contents, he or she may be deemed ineligible.Regardless of whether the candidate intends to purchase an existing business or establish a new one, the Business Establishment Plan must touch on all of the following topics: the business idea, sales and marketing plan, exploratory visit (only in the case of business succession), critical factors, risk factors, investment/financial information, business relationships, and human capital.Business Idea\n",

            "Ontario is Canada's most popular landing destination for immigrants from around the world.As Canada’s most populous province, nearly 40 percent of Canadians call Ontario home. Ontario is also home to Canada’s capital city, Ottawa, and its largest city, Toronto. Ontario is by far the leading destination for newcomers to Canada. The province welcomes one third of all newcomers each year. People chose to land in Ontario because of its job opportunities, high income and diverse population. In fact, more than half of those living in Toronto were born outside of Canada.Ontario’s Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) is called the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP).Through this program, prospective immigrants with the skills and experience targeted by the province may receive a provincial nomination from Ontario, after which they can apply for Canadian permanent residence with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).Complete our FREE assessment to find out if you are eligible for Canadian immigration!Table of ContentsOverview of the Ontario PNPOntario Immigration CategoriesHuman Capital CategoryMasters or PhD CategoryEmployer Job Offer CategoryBusiness CategoryFrequently Asked QuestionsContact us for AssistanceOverview of the Ontario PNPThe Ontario PNP, officially the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP), launched in 2007.The main objectives of the OINP are to respond to skill shortages in targeted areas, make it easier to invest in Ontario, and make sure newcomers can settle and integrate well in the province.When it first started, the Ontario PNP was only allowed to nominate up to 1,000 newcomers. Today, Ontario nominates some 8,000 newcomers per year.Some Ontario immigration streams are base streams and others are enhanced streams.Enhanced streams are those that are aligned with the Express Entry system. This is the federal immigration system that Canada uses to manage permanent residence applications through the country’s three main economic class immigration programs.Through this system, a candidate is given a point score based on the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). The highest-ranking candidates are then invited to apply for permanent residence.Those with nomination from a provincial program that is enhanced get an extra 600 points, effectively guaranteeing getting an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence. They also get their nomination through their Express Entry profile.Base streams are streams that are not aligned with the Express Entry systems. Candidates who get a provincial nomination are required to apply directly to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).Ontario Immigration CategoriesIf you wish to immigrate to Ontario, then you have three categories to choose from:Human Capital Category;Masters or PhD Category;Employer Job Offer Category;Business Category.The Human Capital Category is for skilled workers, French-speaking skilled workers and tradespersons. It is also for international graduates who graduated from an Ontario university with a Masters or PhD degree. No job offer is required to apply through this category.The Employer Job Offer Category is for candidates who have an eligible job offer in Ontario from an employer who is willing to nominate them.Human Capital Category\n",
            "\n",
            "The Human Capital Category itself divides into two sub-streams. One is the Ontario Express Entry. Programs in this sub-stream are enhanced.

From this point, selected candidates have just 45 calendar days to apply to the OINP under this stream. It is important to note that applications submitted outside the 45 calendar days will not be processed. If their application is approved, candidates will be notified of their nomination by the OINP, which they can accept and use to apply to IRCC for permanent residence. There is no set CRS minimum for the Human Capital Priorities Stream. Instead, it can vary from draw to draw.Minimum Eligibility RequirementsTo be eligible under the Ontario Human Capital Priorities Stream, candidates must:Meet the eligibility requirements for one of the Canada's Federal High Skilled programs: Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) or Canadian Experience Class (CEC);Candidates applying through the FSWP must meet the pass mark of 67 points based on IRCC's Federal Skilled Worker selection factors: language skills, education, work experience, age, arranged employment in Canada, and adaptability.Meet the stream's work experience requirements;Have a Canadian Bachelor’s, Master’s or PhD degree OR an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) report produced by a designated organization indicating that the foreign education credential is equivalent to a Canadian Bachelor’s, Master’s or PhD;Note: The ECA report must not be more than five years old as of the date of applying to the OINP.Demonstrate a language proficiency level of Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) 7 or above in all four competencies (speaking, reading, writing, and listening);Language proficiency must be proved by test results from one of the following designated testing agencies taken within the two years prior to submitting the application to the OINP:International English Language Testing System (IELTS) (General Training Test only) orCanadian English Language Proficiency Index Program (CELPIP) (General Test only) for English, andTest d’évaluation de français pour le Canada (TEF Canada) orTest de Connaissance du Français (TCF Canada) for French.Intend to reside in Ontario, by providing documentation to demonstrate ties to Ontario;Hold legal status in Canada (and maintain it until the time of nomination) if they are residing in Canada at the time of applying;The OINP accepts applications submitted while on maintained status.Have obtained a minimum CRS score under the Express Entry system as determined by the director;Meet the additional criteria under either the FSWP or CEC; andPossess sufficient funds to cover settlement costs in Ontario.

Candidates may not apply directly to this stream. Instead, they must first receive a Notification of Interest (NOI) from the OINP based on their Express Entry profile. The OINP searches the Express Entry pool and identifies potential candidates who:Meet the stream's minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) in IRCC's Express Entry system*; andMeet the criteria of Ontario’s Human Capital Priorities Stream (see below).Candidates identified by the OINP will receive an NOI, which will invite them to apply online to the OINP for nomination under the Human Capital Priorities Stream. From this point, selected candidates have just 45 calendar days to apply to the OINP under this stream. It is important to note that applications submitted outside the 45 calendar days will not be processed. If their application is approved, candidates will be notified of their nomination by the OINP, which they can accept and use to apply to IRCC for permanent residence. There is no set CRS minimum for the Human Capital Priorities Stream.

Once a profile is registered in the system, applicants are entered into a selection pool and are given a score based on a series of criteria used to target the most suitable candidates to meet the province's labour market needs.The province conducts draws from the pool and those who selected receive an invitation to apply to the Employer Job Offer: Foreign Worker stream. The next step for those who are invited to apply for a provincial nomination by the province of Ontario is to submit an application online through the OINP e-Filing Portal. Before ApplyingForeign workers looking to apply to the Foreign Worker Stream of the Ontario Employer Job Offer category must first review the job offer, applicant and employer requirements of the program to ensure they are eligible to apply.ApplyingIt may take approximately three hours in total to complete the online application via the OINP e-Filing Portal. Once a registration is completed, applicants have 14 calendar days to complete and submit the application or the registration will expire and become withdrawn.

A letter explaining the reasoning and efforts taken to locate a certified translator must be included with the application. If applying from outside Ontario, the translation must be notarized. If deemed insufficient, the OINP may require applicants to obtain a translation from a certified translator accredited by the ATIO. Translations completed by the applicant, their representative, or others with personal ties to the applicant will not be accepted even if these individuals are considered certified translators. After ApplyingThe OINP considers applications incomplete if incorrect supporting documents are provided or documents requiring translation are not certified or notarized. The OINP refunds application fees if an application is deemed incomplete. Applicants must notify the OINP of any changes to personal information (as outlined in the program guide).Applicants who believe the OINP's decision was made in error may request an internal review of the application within 30 calendar days of receiving the notice of the decision (if residing in Canada) or within 60 calendar days if residing overseas. The request must not include any evidence that was not submitted to the program before the decision was made unless the evidence was not reasonably available at the time of applying.

            "Ontario is Canada's most popular landing destination for immigrants from around the world.As Canada’s most populous province, nearly 40 percent of Canadians call Ontario home. Ontario is also home to Canada’s capital city, Ottawa, and its largest city, Toronto. Ontario is by far the leading destination for newcomers to Canada. The province welcomes one third of all newcomers each year. People chose to land in Ontario because of its job opportunities, high income and diverse population. In fact, more than half of those living in Toronto were born outside of Canada.Ontario’s Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) is called the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP).Through this program, prospective immigrants with the skills and experience targeted by the province may receive a provincial nomination from Ontario, after which they can apply for Canadian permanent residence with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).Complete our FREE assessment to find out if you are eligible for Canadian immigration!Table of ContentsOverview of the Ontario PNPOntario Immigration CategoriesHuman Capital CategoryMasters or PhD CategoryEmployer Job Offer CategoryBusiness CategoryFrequently Asked QuestionsContact us for AssistanceOverview of the Ontario PNPThe Ontario PNP, officially the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP), launched in 2007.The main objectives of the OINP are to respond to skill shortages in targeted areas, make it easier to invest in Ontario, and make sure newcomers can settle and integrate well in the province.When it first started, the Ontario PNP was only allowed to nominate up to 1,000 newcomers. Today, Ontario nominates some 8,000 newcomers per year.Some Ontario immigration streams are base streams and others are enhanced streams.Enhanced streams are those that are aligned with the Express Entry system. This is the federal immigration system that Canada uses to manage permanent residence applications through the country’s three main economic class immigration programs.Through this system, a candidate is given a point score based on the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). The highest-ranking candidates are then invited to apply for permanent residence.Those with nomination from a provincial program that is enhanced get an extra 600 points, effectively guaranteeing getting an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence. They also get their nomination through their Express Entry profile.Base streams are streams that are not aligned with the Express Entry systems. Candidates who get a provincial nomination are required to apply directly to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).Ontario Immigration CategoriesIf you wish to immigrate to Ontario, then you have three categories to choose from:Human Capital Category;Masters or PhD Category;Employer Job Offer Category;Business Category.The Human Capital Category is for skilled workers, French-speaking skilled workers and tradespersons.

            "Ontario is Canada's most popular landing destination for immigrants from around the world.As Canada’s most populous province, nearly 40 percent of Canadians call Ontario home. Ontario is also home to Canada’s capital city, Ottawa, and its largest city, Toronto. Ontario is by far the leading destination for newcomers to Canada. The province welcomes one third of all newcomers each year. People chose to land in Ontario because of its job opportunities, high income and diverse population. In fact, more than half of those living in Toronto were born outside of Canada.Ontario’s Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) is called the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP).Through this program, prospective immigrants with the skills and experience targeted by the province may receive a provincial nomination from Ontario, after which they can apply for Canadian permanent residence with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).Complete our FREE assessment to find out if you are eligible for Canadian immigration!Table of ContentsOverview of the Ontario PNPOntario Immigration CategoriesHuman Capital CategoryMasters or PhD CategoryEmployer Job Offer CategoryBusiness CategoryFrequently Asked QuestionsContact us for AssistanceOverview of the Ontario PNPThe Ontario PNP, officially the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP), launched in 2007.The main objectives of the OINP are to respond to skill shortages in targeted areas, make it easier to invest in Ontario, and make sure newcomers can settle and integrate well in the province.When it first started, the Ontario PNP was only allowed to nominate up to 1,000 newcomers. Today, Ontario nominates some 8,000 newcomers per year.Some Ontario immigration streams are base streams and others are enhanced streams.Enhanced streams are those that are aligned with the Express Entry system. This is the federal immigration system that Canada uses to manage permanent residence applications through the country’s three main economic class immigration programs.Through this system, a candidate is given a point score based on the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). The highest-ranking candidates are then invited to apply for permanent residence.Those with nomination from a provincial program that is enhanced get an extra 600 points, effectively guaranteeing getting an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence. They also get their nomination through their Express Entry profile.Base streams are streams that are not aligned with the Express Entry systems. Candidates who get a provincial nomination are required to apply directly to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).Ontario Immigration CategoriesIf you wish to immigrate to Ontario, then you have three categories to choose from:Human Capital Category;Masters or PhD Category;Employer Job Offer Category;Business Category.The Human Capital Category is for skilled workers, French-speaking skilled workers and tradespersons. It is also for international graduates who graduated from an Ontario university with a Masters or PhD degree. No job offer is required to apply through this category.The Employer Job Offer Category is for candidates who have an eligible job offer in Ontario from an employer who is willing to nominate them.Human Capital Category\n",

Applicants for French-Speaking Skilled Worker must have strong skills in both French and English.If you receive a nomination through Ontario Express Entry, you will be notified.

            "Last updated: \n",
            "14 March 2023\n",
            "Prince Edward Island (PEI), which consists of the island itself and several surrounding isles, is Canada’s smallest province.PEI is considered \"the birthplace of Canada\". The \"Charlottetown conference\" — which led to the country’s formation — took place in PEI in 1864. The island province is renowned not only for its lush farmland and beautiful coasts, but it is also home to a burgeoning economy centred around agriculture, tourism, and fishing. The PEI PNP is Prince Edward Island’s Provincial Nominee Program. Through this program, prospective immigrants with the skills and experience targeted by the province may receive a Prince Edward Island Provincial Nomination Certificate, after which they can apply for Canadian permanent residence with the Government of Canada.Complete our FREE assessment to find out if you are eligible for Canadian immigration!Table of ContentsOverview of the PEI PNPPEI Immigration CategoriesPEI PNP Express EntryLabour Impact CategoryBusiness Impact CategoryContact us for AssistanceOverview of the PEI PNPThe Prince Edward Island Provincial Nominee Program (PEI PNP) launched in 2001 to attract and retain more immigrants to the province who can help address economic and labour market needs and to help achieve economic prosperity.The PEI PNP attracts immigrants with the skills, experience and education who are likely to establish themselves on the island. Thanks to the introduction of the PNP, the province is welcoming an increasing number of immigrants.PEI welcomes the most immigrants per capita in Canada. Prior to the pandemic, it had an immigration rate of about 1.6 per cent, compared to about 0.9 per cent nationally. The province has the highest newcomer intake as a share of population in Canada.The province has welcomed over 2,000 new immigrants every year since 2015, and is expected to continue to welcome an increasing number of immigrants. Prior to the launch of the PNP, the province would welcome less than 200 new immigrants per year.The province has been attracting more immigrants since the introduction of the PNP in 2001 as well as the Atlantic Immigration Pilot (AIP) in 2017. The AIP allows employers in Canada's Atlantic provinces to hire foreign workers for positions that they were not able to fill locally. Canada's Atlantic provinces include New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and PEI.PEI PNP has one enhanced category, the PEI PNP Express Entry category. It also has two base categories: the Labour Impact and Business Impact categories.When a category is aligned with the federal Express Entry system, it is “enhanced\". Canada uses the Express Entry system to manage permanent residence applications through Canada’s main economic class immigration programs.If you are in the Express Entry pool, you will be given a point score based on the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). Canada regularly holds Express Entry draws, where they invite the highest-ranking candidates to apply for permanent residence.Once you are nominated through an enhanced provincial program, such as the PEI PNP Express Entry, you get an additional 600 CRS points. This increase guarantees that you will get an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence in the next draw.

For example, if a candidate has a CLB 7 in Reading, Writing and Speaking, but a 5 in Listening, the CLB will be 5.Language abilityPointsCLB 1040CLB 940CLB 835CLB 730CLB 620CLB 510CLB 4 OR proof of post-secondary studies in English or French0Maximum 40 pointsEducationEducation levelPointsMaster’s level or PhD from a graduate school of a college or university, after completion of a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree20Post-secondary academic degree (Bachelor) from a college or that required at least three years of full-time study17Post-secondary diploma in a specific trade that required at least two years of full-time study after secondary school12Completion of secondary school0\n",

            "Last updated: \n",
            "28 November 2023\n",
            "Quebec holds a unique position in the Canadian immigration landscape because of its French language and cultural heritage. The province operates its own permanent immigration programs. One of the main immigration pathways available to those wishing to settle in Quebec is the Regular Skilled Worker Program (QSWP). Selection under the QSWP is based on the candidates’ profile, their level of education, language skills, work experience, and possible ties to Quebec. This comprehensive CanadaVisa page outlines what you need to know about the QSWP. Complete a free assessment to see if you qualify for the QWSPTable of Contents\n",
            "OverviewImmigration Process Under the QWSPQWSP EligibilityQWSP Selection FactorsQWSP Processing FeesFrequently Asked QuestionsContact Cohen Immigration Law for AssistanceOverviewThe Quebec Regular Skilled Worker Program (QSWP) is a well-established permanent immigration program for skilled workers in Quebec. Similarly to the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSW) under the Express Entry system, foreign nationals who wish to immigrate through the QWSP must first declare their interest in immigrating to Quebec by completing an expression of interest (EOI) form through an online portal. The Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI) regularly selects people from the pool of candidates and invites them to apply for permanent selection.As of November 2023, French proficiency is mandatory for both principal and sponsored applicants in the program. On November 29th, 2024, the Quebec Regular Skilled Worker Program (QSWP) will be replaced by the Qualified Worker Selection Program (QWSP), which will function in much the same way.Recent Application Processing Improvements Under the QWSPIn the past, applications under the QWSP were submitted in paper format and were subject to a quota. Quebec set a maximum number of applications it could receive for the year and a deadline for receiving applications. Once the maximum number of applications was reached, Quebec closed the program to new applications. This “first come, first served” selection system was deemed inefficient and the large inventory of applications received at once resulted in endless backlogs.In other words, under the old application model, the number of applications submitted was far greater than the number of spots available each year for skilled workers. As a result, the waiting time for the successful candidates often spanned several years. For this reason, in 2018, the Quebec Immigration Ministry proceeded with a sort of “reboot,” removing the “first come, first served” approach, backlogged applications and introduced an online Expression of Interest (EOI) system hosted on a platform called “Arrima.”The EOI system gives an equal opportunity for permanent selection to all potential candidates. Anyone 18 years of age or older who wishes to immigrate to Quebec can declare their interest in doing so at any time.Quebec’s Expression of Interest SystemThe EOI system is a two-step process for selecting skilled immigrants, whether they are abroad or already in the province.The first step is to submit an electronic expression of interest for permanent immigration to Arrima. This is a pre-screening process that allows the government to rank interested candidates based on their human capital and labour market-related criteria.The second step is for the government to invite the top-ranked candidates to apply for permanent immigration in regular draws from the pool. The chances of being invited in the draws depend on many factors. These include the government's annual admission targets, its processing capacity, the candidates' ranking scores in the pool, whether there is a job offer, and the targeted occupations at the time of each draw.Immigration Process Under the QSWPFirst, candidates must submit an expression of interest through the Arrima pool. Submitted profiles are scored based on factors such as age, education, language skills and work experience. The top-scoring candidates in the pool may be invited to apply for permanent selection by the Government of Quebec in regularly held draws.Candidates invited to apply to immigrate to Quebec under the QSWP will then use the Mon Projet Quebec portal to complete and submit an application form for permanent selection. The portal allows candidates to complete their application, make their payment online, track the status of their application, make changes to their application and access a personal email throughout the process.Candidates who are successful under the QWSP are issued a Quebec Selection Certificate (CSQ) and can then apply to the Government of Canada for permanent residence. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will conduct a medical and criminal background check as part of its approval process.QSWP EligibilityIn order to be eligible for a CSQ under the QSWP, candidates must obtain sufficient points based on the Quebec Immigration selection grid.This grid is composed of nine factors: education;work experience;age;knowledge of French; stay and family in Quebec;validated job offer;spouse’s characteristics;presence of children;ability to be financially independent. A single (unmarried) candidate must score at least 50 points based on this system, while a candidate with a spouse or common-law partner must score at least 59 points.QWSP Selection FactorsThe Quebec Immigration selection factors are as follows:FactorsPointsEducationUp to 14 points (Cutoff Score = 2 points)Area Of TrainingUp to 12 pointsValidated Employment OfferUp to 14 pointsWork ExperienceUp to 8 pointsAgeUp to 16 pointsLanguage ProficiencyUp to 22 pointsStay And Family In QuebecUp to 8 pointsSpouse/Common-law partner CharacteristicsUp to 17 pointsPresence Of Accompanying ChildrenUp to 8 pointsFinancial Self-Sufficiency1 pointMany of the documents required in order to apply for the Quebec Skilled Worker Program must be certified true copies.

            "1. What is the Quebec Regular Skilled Worker Program (QSWP)?\n",
            "The Quebec Qualified Worker Selection Program (QWSP) is a program for economic immigration candidates who intend to settle in the province of Quebec. Quebec's Ministère de l'immigration, de la francisation et de l'intégration (MIFI) invites candidates to apply for a Quebec Selection Certificate (Certificat de sélection du Québec, or CSQ) based on their Expression of Interest profile, which details their age, education, work experience, proficiency in French, among other factors.\n",
            "2. What is the Arrima Portal?\n",
            "Arrima is an online platform used to manage immigration applications from foreign nationals who wish to immigrate to Quebec under the QSWP. It is a portal open to anyone 18 years of age or older who wishes to submit an expression of interest to apply under the QSWP.\n",
            "3. What is an Expression of Interest?\n",
            "Under the revised Quebec immigration system, as a first step, foreign national who want to immigrate to Québec under the QSWP must first express their interest by filling out an online Expression of Interest form through the Arrima Portal. On this form, individuals must provide information regarding their area of training, educational level, language skills and work experience, as well as additional information. The Ministère periodically invites individuals from the Expression of Interest bank who meet certain criteria, focusing mainly on labour market needs in the various regions of Québec. Having a validated job offer and working in targeted occupations are some of the criteria taken into consideration.\n",
            "4. What is Mon projet Québec?\n",
            "Mon projet Québec is an online system for receiving complete applications to the QSWP. Candidates who are invited to apply for permanent selection by Quebec under the QSWP must register an account on Mon projet Québec to complete the application and submit their supporting documents.\n",
            "5. What is a Quebec Selection Certificate/Certificat du sélection du Québec (CSQ)?\n",
            "A CSQ is the document issued to successful applicants to Quebec immigration programs to show that they have been selected for immigration to Quebec. With a CSQ, a candidate can apply to the Federal government for permanent residence. The CSQ is not a permanent residence visa and cannot be utilized for entry into Canada.\n",
            "6. When does the QSWP program accept submissions?\n",
            "A candidate can create an Expression of Interest (EOI) profile at any time using the online Arrima portal.\n",
            "7. What are my chances of being invited under the QSWP?\n",
            "The Government of Quebec invites candidates on an ongoing basis and according to labour market needs. This means that candidates who have submitted their profile in the Arrima pool and who best meet the economic and political priorities of the province and its regions may be selected at any time based on their socio-professional profile.To maximize your chances of being invited, it is best to make sure your profile in Arrima is up to date.\n",
            "8. Can I make an application to the QSWP without using Arrima?\n",
            "No. Currently, the only way for a candidate to be considered for for immigration to Quebec under the QSWP is to create a profile in Arrima.\n",
            "9. Who can be included on an QSWP application?\n",
            "An applicant can include his or her spouse or common-law partner on the application, as well as any dependent children aged 18 or younger. It is important to note that Canada recognizes same-sex unions.\n",
            "10. If I don't speak French, can still obtain a CSQ?\n",
            "You may be able to obtain a CSQ under the QSWP provided you are awarded enough points in other categories on the selection grid to get a passing score.\n",
            "11. If an applicant ages during the application, does he or she lose eligibility points for the age factor?\n",
            "No. The age of the applicant and the ages of his or her accompanying family members (if applicable) are locked in on the day the application is submitted. For the purposes of points calculation, the applicant and his or her accompanying family members (if applicable) remain the same age throughout the application.\n",
            "12. If a candidate gains new experience while his or her application is being processed, can he or she gain points?\n",
            "Yes. Any changes that may affect the candidate’s application must be declared within 30 days of the change. This includes the addition of new family members, as well as any changes in address, employment, and education – this applies to the accompanying spouse as well. The candidate may gain eligibility points for these changes. It is also important to note that such these changes must be declared even if the change will not affect the points score.\n",
            "13. What is an  attestation of learning about democratic values and the Québec values?\n",
            "Since January 1, 2020, those who submit applications under the QSWP are required to obtain an attestation of learning about democratic values and Quebec values in support of their permanent selection application.To receive the attestation, you must successfully complete an online assessment or attend an information session with Objectif Intégration. Once obtained, the certification is valid for two years. All persons 18 years of age that are included in your application will need to obtain this certificate. More information is available on the Quebec government website.\n",
            "14. What happens if a candidate moves to a different country during the processing of his or her application?\n",
            "Any change in address must be declared to the MIFI. If a candidate moves to a country with a shorter estimated processing time, he or she may be able to request a transfer of the territory treating the application.\n",
            "15. Can a candidate submit an application to the QSWP if he or she intends to live elsewhere in Canada?\n",
            "The QSWP program is intended for prospective immigrants who wish to settle and build a life in Quebec. An application can be refused if the MIFI or the federal immigration authorities believe that the applicant does not intend to settle in Quebec.Once a successful applicant receives a permanent resident visa, he or she (and his or her family, if applicable) must land in Quebec upon arrival in Canada. However, it is important to note that immigrants who obtain permanent residence through the QSWP have the same rights as Canadian citizens and permanent residents in other provinces to move around the country freely and without impediment.\n",
            "16. Can an application for permanent residence be refused at the federal level, after the candidate has obtained a CSQ?\n",
            "Yes. An application can be refused at the federal processing stage for a variety of reasons. The decision to refuse an application at the federal level can be based on criminal background checks, or on the results of medical examinations. An application may also be refused if the federal immigration authorities have reason to believe any of the applicant's claims on their application are untrue, or if the authorities doubt the candidate's intention to reside in Quebec. If you have any concerns regarding criminal or medical inadmissibility to Canada, please contact us.\n",
            "17. If an applicant qualifies as a Quebec selected skilled worker and obtains a CSQ, does he or she then have to meet the points requirement for the Federal Skilled Worker Class?\n",
            "No. It is important to note that the selection criteria for a Quebec Skilled Worker are not the same as those for the Federal Skilled Worker Class. If an applicant obtains a CSQ, his or her application must still be submitted at the federal level for security and medical checks before permanent residence may be granted. However, qualifications are not re-assessed at the federal level, as the province will already have approved the qualifications and selected the applicant (and his or her family, if applicable) for immigration to Quebec.\n",
            "18. Does an applicant first have to be in the Express Entry pool in order to make an application for a CSQ under the QSW Program?\n",
            "No. The process of immigration to Quebec exists outside the federal Express Entry immigration selection system.\n",
            "19. How is immigrating to Quebec different from immigrating to the rest of Canada?\n",
            "Quebec is responsible for selecting immigrants to settle within the province. In order to immigrate to Quebec, candidates must first obtain a CSQ. It is important to note that a CSQ is not a Permanent Residence Visa. Once an application for a CSQ is submitted, candidates’ qualifications are assessed at the provincial level. After receiving approval at the provincial level (CSQ is granted), the candidate must submit an application at the federal level for medical and security checks. After a candidate is approved at the federal level, he or she receives permanent residence.\n",
            "20. Why are the requirements different for a QSWP than for a Federal Skilled Worker application?\n",
            "Quebec is a culturally distinct province, and the only predominantly francophone province in Canada. A candidate’s chances of being selected by Quebec depend on his or her ability and willingness to settle and work in the province and adapt to life in the province. Quebec has had the right to define its own criteria for the selection of immigrants since 1991, when the province signed the Canada-Quebec Accord. This agreement between the provincial and federal governments came about in the context of rising separatist sentiment in Quebec, and although Quebec residents voted to remain part of Canada, the selection of immigrants according to Quebec's own criteria remained an important part of the province's identity. However, the right to move around Canada, as established in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is part of the Canada-Quebec Accord.\n",
            "21. Why is it the QSWP separate from the FSWP?\n",
            "Due to its special status as the only officially Francophone province in Canada, Quebec has the unique authority to manage its own immigration programs. If you are seeking to immigrate to Quebec and live there as a skilled worker, you will not be able to apply through immigration streams such as the Federal Skilled Worker (FSWP). Instead, you must apply under the Quebec Regular Skilled Worker Program (QSWP).Contact us for AssistanceCohen Immigration Law is a leading Canadian immigration law firm with over 45 years of experience.

            "OverviewEligibility Criteria for Temporary Foreign WorkersEligibility Criteria for Quebec GraduatesFrequently Asked QuestionsContact Cohen Immigration Law for AssistanceOverviewThe Quebec Experience Program (Programme de l’expérience québécoise, or PEQ) provides a fast-track way for foreign graduates and individuals with work experience in Quebec to obtain a Quebec selection certificate — a mandatory step towards permanent residency that is granted by the federal government. Unlike other Canadian provinces, Quebec's case is unique because of the Quebec-Canada Agreement, in effect since April 1991, which gives Quebec the authority to select its economic immigrants in the skilled worker category.When the Ministère de l'Immigration, de la Francisation et de l'Intégration (MIFI) created the PEQ, its goal was to ensure that Quebec society could benefit from the contribution of people who had already been here for some time, who knew and shared Quebec's values, and who were already well integrated. By making it easier for employers to hire young graduates of Quebec educational institutions and foreigners already in Quebec, the government seeks both to meet its immigration objectives and to improve Quebec's difficult demographic situation.From its launch year in 2010 through 2019, the program has issued more than 70,000 selection certificates to temporary residents. Due to the popularity of the program, which has resulted in 86 percent of Quebec selection certiﬁcates being issued to PEQ applicants, the Quebec government redesigned it in fall 2019. The purpose of the overhaul was to improve the distribution of applicants across immigration programs and to make the PEQ more responsive to labor market needs.The PEQ is an ideal immigration option for individuals who are fluent in French and have legally acquired work experience in Quebec. The other major advantage of this program is that applications are processed within six months, which is significantly faster than other programs, such as the Quebec Regular Skilled Worker Program  (QSWP).How does the immigration process work with the PEQ?Depending on your situation, you can apply for one of the two streams of the Quebec Experience Program (PEQ):Temporary Foreign WorkersQuébec GraduatesAs of January 2021, PEQ candidates must submit their application, pay the required fee, and upload the required documents via the Arrima portal. Paper applications are no longer accepted. However, those who mailed in their application before January 26, 2021 will not be able to use Arrima to track their file or make changes to their application.Here are the steps to follow to submit an application to the PEQ:Step 1: Choose one of the two permanent selection application forms and fill out the one that fits your situation. Step 2: Prepare the supporting documents as listed in the application form. Step 3: Create your profile on the Arrima platform. Step 4: Submit your complete application package for permanent selection through Arrima.Step 5: Pay the fees for the processing of your application. The Ministère de l'Immigration du Québec will process complete applications within six months. This period begins upon receipt of the complete application, fees and supporting documents.Eligibility Criteria for Temporary Foreign WorkersTemporary Foreign Workers in Quebec may be eligible to apply for a CSQ under the PEQ if they:show an intention to settle in Quebec to hold a job.

            "OverviewEligibility Criteria for Temporary Foreign WorkersEligibility Criteria for Quebec GraduatesFrequently Asked QuestionsContact Cohen Immigration Law for AssistanceOverviewThe Quebec Experience Program (Programme de l’expérience québécoise, or PEQ) provides a fast-track way for foreign graduates and individuals with work experience in Quebec to obtain a Quebec selection certificate — a mandatory step towards permanent residency that is granted by the federal government. Unlike other Canadian provinces, Quebec's case is unique because of the Quebec-Canada Agreement, in effect since April 1991, which gives Quebec the authority to select its economic immigrants in the skilled worker category.When the Ministère de l'Immigration, de la Francisation et de l'Intégration (MIFI) created the PEQ, its goal was to ensure that Quebec society could benefit from the contribution of people who had already been here for some time, who knew and shared Quebec's values, and who were already well integrated. By making it easier for employers to hire young graduates of Quebec educational institutions and foreigners already in Quebec, the government seeks both to meet its immigration objectives and to improve Quebec's difficult demographic situation.From its launch year in 2010 through 2019, the program has issued more than 70,000 selection certificates to temporary residents. Due to the popularity of the program, which has resulted in 86 percent of Quebec selection certiﬁcates being issued to PEQ applicants, the Quebec government redesigned it in fall 2019. The purpose of the overhaul was to improve the distribution of applicants across immigration programs and to make the PEQ more responsive to labor market needs.The PEQ is an ideal immigration option for individuals who are fluent in French and have legally acquired work experience in Quebec. The other major advantage of this program is that applications are processed within six months, which is significantly faster than other programs, such as the Quebec Regular Skilled Worker Program  (QSWP).How does the immigration process work with the PEQ?Depending on your situation, you can apply for one of the two streams of the Quebec Experience Program (PEQ):Temporary Foreign WorkersQuébec GraduatesAs of January 2021, PEQ candidates must submit their application, pay the required fee, and upload the required documents via the Arrima portal. Paper applications are no longer accepted. However, those who mailed in their application before January 26, 2021 will not be able to use Arrima to track their file or make changes to their application.Here are the steps to follow to submit an application to the PEQ:Step 1: Choose one of the two permanent selection application forms and fill out the one that fits your situation. Step 2: Prepare the supporting documents as listed in the application form. Step 3: Create your profile on the Arrima platform. Step 4: Submit your complete application package for permanent selection through Arrima.Step 5: Pay the fees for the processing of your application. The Ministère de l'Immigration du Québec will process complete applications within six months. This period begins upon receipt of the complete application, fees and supporting documents.Eligibility Criteria for Temporary Foreign WorkersTemporary Foreign Workers in Quebec may be eligible to apply for a CSQ under the PEQ if they:show an intention to settle in Quebec to hold a job.

On this trip, the candidate is expected to conduct comprehensive research into the Saskatchewan farming industry and community in the form of meetings with service professionals. Finally, candidates are expected to meet with a representative of the SINP to discuss their proposed farm operation while in Saskatchewan.Business Performance Agreement and Refundable DepositIf the application is approved for nomination, the applicant will be sent a Nomination Approval and Request for Deposit letter, and a Business Performance Agreement. The Business Performance Agreement must be signed by the applicant. In doing so, he or she is committing to purchase and actively operate a farming business in Saskatchewan.

            "Located in the far northwest of Canada, Yukon has a fabled place in the country’s history.Perhaps most famous for the Klondike Gold Rush of the late 1890s, Yukon today is home to approximately 30,000 people, living mostly in the capital of Whitehorse. Its economy is composed primarily of mining and tourism. The territory is an ideal place to settle for individuals who value strong communities and the great outdoors.Prospective immigrants with the skills and experience targeted by the province may get a provincial nomination through Yukon’s Provincial Nominee Program, officially called the Yukon Nominee Program (YNP).Complete our FREE assessment to find out if you are eligible for Canadian immigration!Table of ContentsOverview of the Yukon PNPYukon Immigration StreamsYukon Express Entry (YEE)Yukon Skilled Worker ProgramYukon Critical Impact Worker ProgramYukon Business Nominee ProgramYukon Community PilotContact us for AssistanceOverview of the Yukon PNP\n",
            "The Yukon Nominee Program (YNP) has been in operation since 2002.Yukon uses the YNP to attract more immigrants to the province to address the territory’s labour market needs.The YNP targets skilled workers and businesspersons who have the work experience and required education to succeed in the Yukon territory.Yukon welcomes a few hundred immigrants per year. This, however, makes up almost one per cent of the population. The population of the territory recently reached a record-high of over 40,000.Yukon has one enhanced stream called Yukon Express Entry. The remaining categories are base categories.This means that the Yukon Express Entry is aligned with Canada’s Express Entry system. A base category, on the other hand, is one that is not aligned with the Express Entry system.Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), Canada’s immigration department, uses the Express Entry system to manage the main economic class immigration programs.If you have an Express Entry profile, you are are given a point score according to the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS).Canada regularly holds Express Entry draws, where the highest-ranked candidates are invited to apply for permanent residence.If after you apply, you are nominated through a provincial program, you get an extra 600 CRS points.This means that you will get an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence in the next draw.In addition, you will also get your nomination through the Express Entry profile. You will have to accept this nomination so you can get the extra points.The main advantage of enhanced immigration streams is that the processing standard is usually six months or less. For base streams, the processing standard may exceed 12 months.Most PNP immigration streams are base streams, that are not aligned with Express Entry.You will have to apply directly with IRCC if you get nominated through a base immigration stream. Yukon Immigration Categories:\n",
